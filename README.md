# Product Analysis Website

This is the live site link [Cholonbil Village Foods](https://product-analysis-website-cvf.netlify.app/).

* At first I installed react router and tailwind css for this project.
* Then the header component was added.
* The homepage is designed for showing some introduction of this site and in the last section three customer reviews are added.
* For the review component data loading i used a custom hook.
* In the dashboard section i have added some interesting rechart based on data.
* In blog section I have answered some questions. 
* For any invalid route i have set a 404 page.
